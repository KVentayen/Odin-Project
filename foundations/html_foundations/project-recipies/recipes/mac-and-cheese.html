		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		This homemade mac and cheese is topped with buttered bread crumbs for pure comfort food. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan to make a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 oz uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
			<li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 1/2 cups milk, or more as needed</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 cup finely grated Parmesean cheese</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bread Crumb Topping</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
			<li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Steps</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
			<li>To make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and shimmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
			<li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.</li>
			<li>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesean cheese; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed.</li>
			<li>Pour cheese sauce oer macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
			<li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned.</li>
			<li>Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
